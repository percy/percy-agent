      If alternate hostname support is working, there should be an svg image of the vue logo below.
    </p>
    <p>
      It works because localhost.me resolves to 127.0.0.1, allowing us to serve the vue logo over
      it, and we start the integration tests by specifying localhost.me as an allowed-hostname
      with the -h flag.
